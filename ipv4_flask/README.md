# Overview

This Flask web application is designed to provide users with an interactive quiz on IPv4 subnetting. Users are presented with questions about network addresses, broadcast addresses, and usable host ranges within given subnets. The application tracks the user's progress, calculates their score, and measures the time taken to answer each question.

#### Key Components

1. **Flask Application Setup**: 
   - `app = Flask(__name__)`: Initializes the Flask application.
   - `app.secret_key`: Sets a secret key used for session management.

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - `generate_random_ipv4_address(subnet)`: Generates a random IPv4 address within the specified subnet.
   - `generate_random_cidr_prefix()`: Generates a random CIDR prefix length.
   - `generate_subnetting_question()`: Creates a subnetting question by generating a random IP address and subnet.

3. **Routes**:
   - `@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`: Main route for the IPv4 quiz.
   - `@app.route('/result')`: Route to display the quiz results.

4. **Session Management**:
   - The application uses Flask's session mechanism to store quiz details such as question information, user responses, and the number of correct answers.

#### Functionality

1. **IPv4 Quiz (`ipv4_quiz` function)**:
   - Initializes quiz session data.
   - Processes user responses if the request method is 'POST'.
   - Validates user answers and calculates the score.
   - Generates the next question and updates the session.
   - Redirects to the result page once all questions are answered.
   - Renders the quiz template with current question information.

2. **Quiz Results (`quiz_result` function)**:
   - Retrieves quiz details from the session.
   - Calculates the total time and average time per question.
   - Clears the session for a new quiz attempt.
   - Renders the result template with quiz performance details.

#### Templates

- `quiz.html`: Displays the current question and form for user input.
- `result.html`: Shows the quiz results, including the user's score and time statistics.

#### Running the Application

- The application is run by executing `app.run(debug=True)`, which starts the Flask development server.

#### Note

- The `your_secret_key` placeholder in `app.secret_key` should be replaced with an actual secret key for production use.
- Additional templates (`quiz.html` and `result.html`) are referenced but not provided in the code snippet. These templates should be created with the appropriate HTML structure to display the quiz and results.

#### Conclusion

This application provides an engaging way to test and improve knowledge on IPv4 subnetting. It's a complete web-based quiz system utilizing Flask's capabilities for session management, routing, and template rendering.
